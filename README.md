# Summer-Research2019
All of the code was written and run on Pytorch and Terminal in Ubuntu. The version of Pytorch used was 3.7, and server GPUs were utilized
which if there is no access to them the code switches to CPU.

There are 5 mini-projects here:

1. Neural Forestry, trying to classify forest ecosystems base on satelite spectral data:
neural_network.ipynb
2. Using a CNN to classify the classic Cats and Dogs case:
Load.py, Split.py, CatsDogs.py
3. Linear Regression for Parkinson's UPDRS Score:
convert_to_float.py, Regression.py
4. Adversarial examples generated by ResNET18 model:
adversarial_.py, grid.py
5. VisualBackProp:
data, insights, utils, vis_backprop_test.py
